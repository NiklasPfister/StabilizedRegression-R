Description: Contains an implementation of StabilizedRegression, a regression framework for heterogeneous data based on Pfister et al. (2019) <arXiv:1911.01850>. The procedure uses an averaging estimator to perform a regression of a set of predictors X on a response variable Y which remains stable with respect to a given environment variable. The resulting regression leads to a straightforward variable selection technique allowing to distinguish between stable and unstable predictors. The package further implements a visualization technique which can be used to illustrate the trade-off between stability and predictiveness of individual predictors.
