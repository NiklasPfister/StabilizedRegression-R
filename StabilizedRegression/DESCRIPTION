Description: Contains an implementation of StabilizedRegression, a regression framework for heterogeneous data introduced in Pfister et al. (2019) <arXiv:1911.01850>. The procedure uses averaging to estimate a regression of a set of predictors X on a response variable Y by enforcing stability with respect to a given environment variable. The resulting regression leads to a variable selection procedure which allows to distinguish between stable and unstable predictors. The package further implements a visualization technique which illustrates the trade-off between stability and predictiveness of individual predictors.
