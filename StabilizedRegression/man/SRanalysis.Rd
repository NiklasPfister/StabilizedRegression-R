\arguments{
\item{X}{predictor matrix. Numeric matrix of size n times d, where
columns correspond to individual predictors.}

\item{Y}{response variable. Numeric vector of length n.}

\item{A}{stabilizing variable. Numeric vector of length n which
can be interpreted as a factor.}

\item{num_reps}{number of resamples to use in stability selection.}

\item{pred_scores}{characeter vector of length 2, specifying the
\code{pred_score} for SR and SRpred.}

\item{prescreen_types}{characeter vector of length 2, specifying
the \code{prescreen_type} for SR and SRpred.}

\item{pars_SR}{list of all remaining parameters going into
StabilizedRegression. \code{compute_predictive},
\code{pred_score} and \code{prescreen_type} are ignored.}

\item{threshold}{numeric value between 0 and 1, specifying in
stability selection at which value to select variables.}

\item{cores}{number of cores used in mclapply.}

\item{verbose}{0 for no output, 1 for text output and 2 for text
and diagnostic plots.}

\item{seed}{fix the seed value at the beginning of the function.}
}
\value{
Object of class 'SRanalysis' consisting of the following
  elements

\item{results}{List of stability selection results for for SR, SRpred and SRdiff.}
\item{beta_stab}{Vector of average coefficient signs for SR}
\item{beta_pred}{Vector of average coefficient signs for SRpred}
}
\description{
Stability analysis based on stabilized regression
}
\details{
This function performs two version of StabilizedRegression: SR
which selects a stable and predictive model and SRpred which fits
a plain predictive model. Stability selection is then performed
using the variable importance measures from both these methods and
from their difference SRdiff as variable selection criterion. This
allows to distinguish between which predictive variables are
stable and which are unstable with respect to the stabilizing
variable A. The results can be visualized by plotting the
resulting object using the plot() function.

Due to the resampling this function can be quite computationally
involved, we therefore recommend making use of the \code{cores}
parameter for parallel computations.

## Example
set.seed(1)
X1 <- rnorm(200)
Y <- X1 + rnorm(200)
X2 <- 0.5 * X1 + Y + 0.2 * c(rnorm(100), rnorm(100)+3)

X <- cbind(X1, X2)
A <- as.factor(rep(c(0, 1), each=100))

obj <- SRanalysis(X, Y, A, 10,
                  pars_SR=list(B=NA))
plot(obj)
print(obj$results)
